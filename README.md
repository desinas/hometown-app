# site responsiveness improvement  #

The Brighton Times site with two coloumns: text and images,
also the weather and sports scores. When resize the page the content is no longer fitting the browser.
So to make it responsive:
- Add a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale.
- Adjust CSS and markup to display in a single column. Use relative widths so to stretch elements to fit any viewport.
- Touch targets are easy to hit by finger.
- Testing the site across different viewports.
